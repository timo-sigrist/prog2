/**
 * Helper class to support simple network communication.
 * It provides access to the two subclasses:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link NetworkServer} is used on the server side to open a port and wait for connection request from clients</li>
 *     <li>{@link NetworkConnection} represents a bidirectional connection between client and server, to send and
 *     receive Objects</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The typical process works as follows</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The server creates a {@link NetworkServer} instance using the factory method
 *     {@link NetworkHandler#createServer(int port)}. This creates and opens a port (range: 0 - 65535)
 *     on all available interfaces (IP-networks, incl. localhost loopback) of the current host.</li>
 *     <li>As soon the server is ready to receive requests it calls the method {@link NetworkServer#waitForConnection()}
 *     which is blocking and waiting for client to open a connection.</li>
 *     <li>On the client side, a new {@link NetworkConnection} instance is created to connect to the server using the
 *     factory method {@link NetworkHandler#openConnection(String host, int port)}, which opens a connection to the
 *     given host (domainname or ip-address) on the specified server port</li>
 *     <li>On the server side, the waiting method {@link NetworkServer#waitForConnection()} returns an instance of
 *     {@link NetworkConnection} which represents the specific connection to the calling client.</li>
 *     <li>This connection can be used to send and receive data between server and client.</li>
 *     <li>On the server side, the handling of each interaction ('session') with a specific client should be handled in
 *     a separate {@link Thread}, after starting the thread, the server can go back and wait for the next connection
 *     request.</li>
 *     <li>Both sides (server & client) need to handle sending and receiving of data separately
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>reading data: call {@link NetworkConnection#receive()}, which is blocking until a data object is
 *             received. As soon the object has been received, the method returns an instance of the object.
 *             This object (request) can be processed (on the server side, usually a response is sent back;
 *             on the client side, usually the result is displayed to the user). After processing is finished the
 *             process calls {@link NetworkConnection#receive()} again to wait for the next request.
 *             </li>
 *             <li>sending data: call {@link NetworkConnection#send(Serializable data)}, which sends the given data
 *             object to the remote side. The method returns as soon the object has been transmitted.
 *             <b>Important: {@link NetworkConnection} is not thread safe</b>, therefore make sure that only one thread
 *             at a time is sending data.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *         <b>Important:Sending and receiving of data is completely asynchronous and can happen in parallel.</b>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>The connection stays open until one of the peers decides to close it using {@link NetworkConnection#close()}.
 *     In this case, all waiting method calls (e.g. {@link NetworkConnection#receive()} on the opposite side are
 *     interrupted and a {@link EOFException} is thrown.<br>
 *     On the local side, waiting method calls (threads) are also interrupted and a {@link java.net.SocketException}
 *     is thrown.</li>
 *     <li>To stop receiving new connection requests on the server side, the server may call
 *     {@link NetworkServer#close()} which will close all currently open {@link NetworkConnection} objects.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>{@link NetworkServer} and {@link NetworkConnection} are typed using generics. This means, when creating an
 * instance it has to be specified, what types of objects can be sent between server and client. The type has to be
 * identical on both sides of the connection. These Objects have to be of type {@link Serializable}, which is a
 * marker interface specifying that an object can be serialized/deserialized. As long all properties within a
 * class are also Serializable, your class simply can be marked using it. All standard Java data-types are by default
 * Serializable.</p>
